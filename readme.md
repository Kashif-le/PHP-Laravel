this project is a student managment system, built using a PHP frame work (Laravel).
I have integerate a AdminLTE theme with the laravel components to get the desired interface, rest of the functionality is added afterwards.

TO run this prject:
1- first you need to setup the environemnt for the laravel to run on your mechine, you can find different tutorials on youtube.
2- then you have to run the migrations using php artisan command, to get the database ready and you are good to go.

if you are a beginner, and want to start Laravel from scrach, upto a functional website, then you might want to visit the link below.
