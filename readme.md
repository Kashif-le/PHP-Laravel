This project is a student managment system, built using a PHP web-framework (Laravel).
I have integerated a AdminLTE Template with laravel to get the desired interface, rest of the functionality is added afterwards.

TO run this prject:
1- First you need to setup the environemnt for the laravel to run on your mechine, you can find different tutorials on youtube.
2- Then you have to run the migrations using php artisan command, to get the database ready and you are good to go.

Iif you are a beginner, and want to start Laravel from scrach and upto a functional website, then you might want to visit the link below.
